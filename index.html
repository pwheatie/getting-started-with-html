<h1>The basics of the Web and Html</h1>

<h3><em>World Wide Web</em></h3>
  <p>It is a collection of html documents. The links between pages make it web like. Major pieces include your <em>computer, the internet, and servers</em>.</p> 
   <p1>Additional Concepts:</p1>
  <p>Request through the internet use a protocol called http & servers are computers designed for file storage.</p>
<h3><em>Four things about HTML</em></h3>
<p><b>Text content</b> is what your see, <b>markup</b> is what it looks like, <b>references</b> link to other documents and <b>link</b> to other pages.</p> 
 <p1>Additional Concepts</p1>
  <p>Html markup contains elements that contain the opening tags and closing tags. In between these tags are the content. These tags are the basis of the html markup language.</p>
<h3>Html Attributes</h3>
   <p>html attributes allow you to assign properties to html elements. For instance: "a href" is where <em>a</em> is an anchor tag and <em>href</em> is the attribute. The popular image element uses the attribute <em>src</em> to link images in web pages.

<h3>White Space</h3>
   <p>White space is critical for a properly designed webpage. Since Html will line up one element after another, a proper web designer must use white space to break up elements so the page is readable and aesthetically pleasant. A great video on the importance of whitespace can be seen here: <a href= "https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48666064/m-48678767">Whitespace</a> 
   </p> 
   <p1>Additional Concepts</p1>
   <p>Both <em>Span</em> and <em>Div</em> are elements used to produce whitespace. <em>Span</em> is an inline element, while <em>Div</em> is a block element.
